JAVASCRIPT ROADMAP — 2026

This roadmap is a practical, year-agnostic plan for becoming a strong, job-ready JavaScript developer in 2026. It covers fundamentals, modern language features, frameworks, ecosystem tools, testing, deployment, performance, security, career tips, and suggested projects and timelines. Use it as a checklist and adapt the pace to your experience.

  * Build sample REST API and GraphQL API (Apollo Server or GraphQL Yoga)

---

8. DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE (2–4 weeks)

* Containers & CI/CD

  * Docker basics: Dockerfile, image, container, volumes
  * Continuous integration: GitHub Actions examples for build/test/deploy
* Hosting platforms

  * Frontend: Vercel, Netlify
  * Backend: Render, Fly.io, DigitalOcean, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk / ECS / Lambda)
* Databases & managed services

  * PlanetScale, Supabase, Neon, AWS RDS

---

9. TESTING & QUALITY (2–4 weeks)

* Unit testing

  * Jest fundamentals (mocks, snapshots)
  * Testing-library for React (user-focused tests)
* Integration and E2E

  * Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end tests
* Contract testing & type-safety between client and server

  * Use ts-proto or type-safe clients

---

10. PERFORMANCE, ACCESSIBILITY & SECURITY (ongoing)

* Performance

  * Web vitals, Lighthouse, code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
  * Caching strategies, CDN, HTTP headers, compression
* Accessibility (a11y)

  * Semantic HTML, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast
  * axe-core and automated checks
* Security

  * OWASP top 10 overview, XSS, CSRF, CORS, SQL/NoSQL injection
  * Secure headers, rate limiting, input validation

---

11. ADVANCED TOPICS (pick based on career goals)

* Mobile/web hybrid

  * React Native, Expo
* Server-side rendering & meta-frameworks

  * Next.js (pages vs app router), Remix, Nuxt (Vue)
* Edge computing

13. 6-MONTH LEARNING PLAN (Example)
    Month 1: JavaScript fundamentals + ES6
    Month 2: DOM, small projects, Git, basic algorithms
    Month 3: TypeScript + React basics
    Month 4: Advanced React (hooks, router), state management
    Month 5: Node.js backend, databases, REST API
    Month 6: Deployment, testing, build a full-stack project

---

14. PROJECT IDEAS (build and showcase these)

* Single-page apps

  * Task manager with local DB + sync
  * Expense tracker with charts
* Full-stack apps

  * Social feed with user auth, likes, comments
  * E-commerce checkout simulation (cart, payments mock)
* Real-time app

  * Chat app with presence indicators and typing status
* Mini open-source library

  * Tiny UI component, utility library, or CLI tool

---

15. RESOURCES & LEARNING HABITS

* Docs and references

  * MDN Web Docs, ECMAScript specs, TypeScript docs
* Practical learning

  * Build projects, contribute to open-source, read source code
* Curated courses & books (pick up-to-date sources)

  * "You Don’t Know JS" (book series), official framework docs
* Keep a learning journal, track progress, publish projects on GitHub

---

16. CHECKLIST BEFORE APPLYING TO JOBS

* Portfolio with 3–6 real projects (hosted & source code)
* Clean, typed code examples (TypeScript where possible)
* Tests and CI configured for at least 1 project
* Resume + LinkedIn with project links and short descriptions
* Prepared for system design and coding interviews

---

Notes:

* The JavaScript ecosystem evolves quickly. Always check the latest docs for frameworks and tools. Focus on fundamentals and transferable concepts (async patterns, component architecture, types).
* Choose depth over breadth: get deeply proficient in one frontend framework (commonly React) and one backend approach (Node + Express + a DB) before exploring many alternatives.
